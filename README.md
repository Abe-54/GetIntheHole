## Get In The Hole
This is an endless mini game the player is a beach ball and has to reach a hole in the falling ground, who's position in the falling ground is randomized each wave. The game was built within the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine.

## Motivation
This is my midterm project for a game programming course I am currently enrolled in.
